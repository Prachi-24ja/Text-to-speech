# Text-to-speech

A Text-to-Speech (TTS) converter is a tool that transforms written text into spoken words. By utilizing technologies like the Web Speech API, a TTS converter allows users to input text and have it read aloud by a synthetic voice. This feature is particularly useful for enhancing accessibility, providing auditory feedback, and creating interactive applications. Users can typically customize the speech output by adjusting parameters such as voice type and volume making the experience more tailored to their preferences.
